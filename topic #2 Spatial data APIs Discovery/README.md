# Topic 2: Spatial data APIs Discovery
## Introduction 
This folder contains working drafts, test data and results/reports of the topic 2. The aim of topic 2 is "...to make a collection of spatial data discoverable (i.e. FAIR Findable) on the web, using OGC API standards, and to report on how this can best be done..."

## Our Scope
This topic takes place in the marine domain, specifically in waters mainly (but not exclusively) governed, managed and mapped by hydrographic agencies and using standards which are defined by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). Specifically, our topic looks at how existing/emerging international standards can be leveraged using OGC API methodologies, OGC API Records:

The objectives of the research are: 
* Demonstrate how IHO S-100 marine data can be discovered using existing OGC API methodologies and the ISO 19115 metadata embedded in S-100 datasets and service discovery metadata within ISO S-128.
* Setup a testbed for a region with multiple S-100 datasets and service definitions in S-128 and provide dataset discoverability services using OGC API methodologies.
* Feedback to the OGC community, primarily through OGC MDWG, and IHO, through the upcoming revision to S-100 (edition 5.0.0) on any modifications to the standards base to more easily enable interoperability between the two frameworks.
* Produce a documented initial approach detailing how the discoverability elements can be used as a prototype to develop full OGC/IHO interoperability and the potential for such interoperability.
