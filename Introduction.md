The public sector creates a lot of geospatial data - a lot of it being open data -. These data could be useful to others, who are often not experts on spatial data. Can spatial APIs help out? That is what we wanted to find out in a testbed on spatial data APIs. Recordings of all publice presentations of this testbed can be found here https://www.geonovum.nl/themas/testbed-ogc-apis/invitation-to-tender-spatial-data-apis

Goal of the testbed was to detect key success factors/best practices to enable more organizations and businesses to use spatial data. The tender targeted five specific research topics, the final reports of which can be found in this document. Each researchtopic has its own chapter.
